# SafeSurf VPN - Minimal Development Environment
# ===============================================

# This is a minimal .env configuration for development and testing.
# Copy this to .env if you want to run SafeSurf with minimal dependencies.

# =============================================================================
# MINIMAL REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Database (SQLite for development)
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# Basic auth secret (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
AUTH_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-here-change-this-in-production"

# =============================================================================
# THAT'S IT! 
# =============================================================================

# With just these two variables, you can:
# ✅ Run the application
# ✅ Create accounts with email/password
# ✅ Navigate through all pages
# ✅ View the admin interface
# ✅ See trial subscriptions created (without VPN configs)

# What won't work without additional config:
# ❌ Google OAuth sign-in (need AUTH_GOOGLE_ID, AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET)
# ❌ Password reset emails (need RESEND_API_KEY, RESEND_FROM_EMAIL)
# ❌ VPN config generation (need 3x-UI panel configuration)
# ❌ Payment processing (need YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID, YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY)

# To enable more features, copy from .env.example and configure as needed.
